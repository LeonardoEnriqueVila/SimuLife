# Sims 1 Style Simulation

This is an unfinished project simulating a game similar to "The Sims 1" using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. The project includes a basic interface and some initial gameplay mechanics. 

## Description

The project aims to create a simulation game where players can control characters, manage their needs, and build environments. Although the project is not complete, it includes some foundational elements and basic interactions.

Anyway, this project is really far to be a finished product and i see this more as a practice where i was able to learn a lot of things about typescript like managing events. 

## Features

- Character needs.
